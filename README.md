# SeqSee

`SeqSee` (pronounced "seek-see") is a generic visualization tool for spectral sequence data. It aims
to decouple the challenge of working with spectral sequences mathematically from the challenge of
displaying them graphically. We present a [JSON schema](#input-schema) that can serve as a lingua
franca between these two aspects.

By way of example, we have included a tool called `jsonmaker`, which can convert the CSV files found
[here](https://zenodo.org/records/6987157) and [here](https://zenodo.org/records/6987227) into JSON
files following our schema. This script is specific to the format of those CSV files, but serves as
a template for creating tools to generate JSON data that `SeqSee` can display. It is expected that
any software that manipulates spectral sequences will require a customized tool to produce JSON
files that follow the SeqSee schema.

`SeqSee` takes a JSON file as input, conforming to the SeqSee schema, and outputs a self-contained
HTML file. This file includes an SVG figure representing the spectral sequence along with JavaScript
for interactivity.

The HTML files generated by `SeqSee` have a few dependencies and cannot be used offline. However,
these dependencies are small and are likely to be cached after the file is opened for the first
time. Specifically, they depend on:

- `svg-pan-zoom` 3.6.1 for interactivity.
- `katex` 0.16.2, along with its CSS and `auto-render` extension, for rendering LaTeX in titles and
  labels.
- `hammer` 2.0.8 to handle touch inputs.
- The "Computer Modern" font for the title and axis labels.

For demonstration purposes, the script `convert_all` takes every CSV file in `csv/`, converts them
to JSON using `jsonmaker`, and then converts each JSON file in `json/` into an HTML file using
`SeqSee`.

## Running SeqSee

`SeqSee` is packaged with Poetry for easy dependency management and script execution. Below are the
instructions for setting up and running `SeqSee`.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** 3.11+
- **Poetry** for dependency management

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:JoeyBF/SeqSee.git
   cd SeqSee
   ```

2. **Initialize the Environment:** Install the scripts using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   poetry install
   ```

### Usage

Once set up, you can use the following commands:

- **Generate a Spectral Sequence Chart**:

  ```bash
  seqsee input_file.json output_chart.html
  ```

- **Convert CSV to JSON**: To convert the CSV data in `csv/` to a JSON file compatible with
  `SeqSee`, use:

  ```bash
  jsonmaker input_file.csv output_file.json
  ```

- **Convert Multiple Files**: For batch conversion or processing:

  ```bash
  convert_all
  ```

  This script converts every CSV file in `csv/` to a JSON file in `json/`, then converts every JSON
  file in `json/` to an HTML chart in `html/`.

These commands are registered as Poetry scripts, so they can be run directly after activating the
environment with `poetry shell`.

## Input Schema

The input JSON file contains three primary sections: `header`, `nodes`, and `edges`. Each section
defines configuration options for generating a spectral sequence chart, and any section can be
omitted.

To validate the JSON file against the SeqSee schema in compatible IDEs, add `"$schema":
"seqsee/input_schema.json"` at the top level.

### Sections

#### `header`

Contains global settings for chart configuration.

- **`metadata`**: Holds metadata about the chart.
  - **`htmltitle`**: The `<title>` of the HTML output. Defaults to "".
  - Any other key-value pair is accepted, but will have no effect on the output. This is useful for
    tagging output files, since the JSON format does not allow comments. Potentially useful data
    might include `author`, `date`, `source`, `version`, `description`, etc.

- **`chart`**: Holds configuration for the visuals of the chart.
  - **`width`**: The chart width, or `null` for automatic detection based on `nodes`. Defaults to
    `null`.
  - **`height`**: The chart height, or `null` for automatic detection based on `nodes`. Defaults to
    `null`.
  - **`scale`**: A number representing the grid scale in pixels. Each unit increase along the axes
    corresponds to this many pixels. Defaults to `60`.
  - **`nodeSize`**: Defines the radius of nodes as a multiple of `scale`. Defaults to `0.04`.
  - **`nodeSpacing`**: Specifies the distance between nodes in the same bidegree, measured between
    their circumferences. Defaults to `0.02`.
  - **`nodeSlope`**: The slope of the line along which nodes are positioned:
    - `0`: Horizontal alignment
    - `null`: Vertical alignment
    - Any floating point value is accepted.

- **`defaultAttributes`**: Specifies default visual attributes for nodes and edges.
  - **`nodes`**: An [attribute list](#attribute-lists) applied to all nodes by default. Defaults to
    `[ {"color": "black"} ]`. **Note:** Specifying default node size here overrides automatic
    spacing; node size should generally be set in `header/chart/nodeSize` for automatic spacing.
  - **`edges`**: An [attribute list](#attribute-lists) applied to all edges by default. Defaults to
    `[ {"thickness": 0.02, "pattern": "solid"} ]`.

- **`aliases`**: Allows shorthand for reusable colors and attributes.
  - **`colors`**: Maps color names to valid CSS color values.
  - **`attributes`**: Maps names to predefined [attribute lists](#attribute-lists), which can be
    applied to nodes or edges for consistent styling.

#### `nodes`

Defines individual nodes in the chart. Each key is a unique node identifier mapping to an object
with the following properties:

- **`x`**: X-coordinate (required).
- **`y`**: Y-coordinate (required).
- **`position`**: An integer representing the index position within a bidegree. Negative values are
  positioned further left, and positive values are positioned further right. Ties are broken by the
  order in which the nodes occur in the input JSON. Defaults to `0`.
- **`label`**: A LaTeX string for the node label, displayed in a tooltip on hover.
- **`attributes`**: An [attribute list](#attribute-lists) for node-specific styling.

#### `edges`

Defines directed or undirected edges between nodes.

- **`source`**: The identifier of the starting node (required).
- **`target`**: The identifier of the ending node. Exactly one of `target` or `offset` is required.
- **`offset`**: Relative positioning from the source node, if `target` is not specified. Used for
  freestanding edges, often styled as arrows, that only have one endpoint at a node.
  - **`x`**: X-offset from the source node.
  - **`y`**: Y-offset from the source node.
- **`attributes`**: An [attribute list](#attribute-lists) for edge-specific styling.

#### Attribute Lists

Attribute lists are arrays of styling properties defining the visual characteristics of nodes and
edges. Each entry is a string (aliasing an attribute list) or an object with the following
properties:

- **`color`**: A string representing the color. Accepts any CSS color value or a predefined color
  from `header/aliases/colors`.
- **`size`**: Specifies the element's size as a multiple of the chart scale. Applies to nodes
  (radius).
- **`thickness`**: Specifies thickness as a multiple of the chart scale. Applies mainly to edges;
  for nodes, it sets the circle border thickness (typically kept at 0 to maintain proper spacing).
- **`arrowTip`**: Defines the arrow tip type on an edge. Valid values are `"none"` (no arrow head)
  or `"simple"` (simple arrow head).
- **`pattern`**: Specifies the line pattern for edges. Valid values are `"solid"`, `"dashed"`, or
  `"dotted"`.
- Any other property is treated as raw CSS.

Strings in an attribute list reference their own attribute list in `header/aliases/attributes`. When
multiple properties are specified, directly specified properties take precedence. If conflicts
remain, later entries in the list override previous ones.

## Examples

- An empty chart:

  ```json
  {}
  ```

- A 2x2 chart showing a single black node at the origin, labeled `1`:

  ```json
  {

## Future Development

`SeqSee` is designed with flexibility in mind, making it straightforward to extend its capabilities.
Potential areas for development include:

- **Customizable Styles**: Add support for more node and edge styles, such as curved edges, shadow
  effects, or different node shapes.
- **Advanced Interactivity**: Implement features like node/edge selection, more hover effects, and
  dynamic highlighting.
- **Improved Coordinate Systems**: Allow more customization of axes, gridlines, and coordinates for
  specialized use cases.
